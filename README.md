# info202

## Description
This repo is designed for UC Berkeley's [INFO 202 course](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/courses/info/202) at the [School of Information](https://www.ischool.berkeley.edu/) for the fall 2022 semester. The assignment was to design a personal website that had a little bit of information based on a given template and some bootstrap CSS with the intention of understanding HTML/CSS better, figure out a little of relative path debugging, and formatting JSON into XML (not included in the repo).

Already having my own portfolio at [andyvo.com](https://andyvo.com), I chose to rewrite all of the CSS to match my styles. I applied a more modern style to my page to not only get in the habit of good design/front-end practices, but also to explore a bit of creativity since I am looking to redesign my portfolio yet again from HTML/CSS/JS to React.js/TS.

## JSON
The JSON file that I have changed derives from the Spotify API. Pulling my top 10 Spotify songs over the last month, I used Postman to better format my JSON to extract only the key objects I needed.

## Future designs
Well, I'm still in the brainstorming phase of redesigning my portfolio on Figma but we shall see. I like the video that I added to this project as it is a reflection of myself. If you have any thoughts, email me at [andyvo@berkeley.edu](mailto:andyvo@berkeley.edu).
